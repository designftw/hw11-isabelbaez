				<h3>Replies</h3>
				<p> For my replies implementation, I added replies in the format of a post, with a toggling the allowed to view versus hide replies, as well as an edit and delete button for each reply.

				<h3>Reads</h3>
				<p> For my reads, I also created a separate component. I represented them as a list of names at the bottom of each message. I considered adding profile pics as read indicators (as Messenger does), but concluded that the trade-off in loading time was not worth it. I made sure to read every message that appared on a user's feed, and to do so only once. Moreover, I accounted for users who may have read more than once and made sure to only list their usernames once.

				<h3>Profile Pictures</h3>
				<p> For my profile pictures, I implemented the Profile component. I added these to each post in a small circle, assimilating other chatting apps for consistency. These also expand when users hover over them. Moreover, I allowed a user to edit and change their own profile picture alongside the functionality to edit name and username.
