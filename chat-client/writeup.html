			<p>Once again, I did most of my development for this assignment in the format of a mobile-style screen, as that 
				is what I predict to be the most common use case for my app. This format is also what I tested in my paper 
				and figma prototypes. Due to this, although my design is universal, I suggest a mobile format (through Inspect) 
				for a better user experience.</p>

			<p>The main problem that my chat app seeks to target is the organization of academic groupchats. Platforms, such 
				as Piazza, provide a good centralized space for classroom interaction. However, they lack the casualness and 
				conventionality of regular messaging apps, such as Messeger.</p>

			<p> Through EduChat, users can join classes as they do on Piazza, these classes are created by a registrar entity 
				and are fixed based on the institution. Users can then join/leave classes. Within each class, users can create 
				groupchats. These groupchates are similar to regular messaging applications, making them more
				accessible than other platforms, such as Slack. This groupchats are limited to class members, which was an important 
				part of the second half of my implementation: limiting groupchat participants to members of the given class, and 
				notifying the user of this, whether it be in chat creation or chat modification. </p>

			<p> Some things differed from my wireframes. I had not accounted for certain logistics, such as what it means when a user 
				leaves a class (in the current implementation, all group chats they created are deleted and they are taken off from the 
				participants of all the others they belonged to). This prevents our specificaton from being violated: users cannot be part of
				a groupchat in a class they are not a part of. </p>
			
			<p> Such complexities also led to some simplifications in my design. I took away the toggling between joining a class as a student
				or instructor. Originally, instructors would be able to be admins in the main class groupchat. However, since this would require them
				to create the groupchat, they would need to join the class before any student. Together with the structure of Graffiti, this hierarchy 
				did not seem to fit. Similarly, in my wireframes I had not thought about class leaving, which is a functionality I had to implement.
			</p>
				
			<p> As next steps in the future, I would like to implement the link/file pinning feature I previously stated as tentitive. In this
				iteration, I chose to prioritize the class-group chat hierarchy and its multiple intricacies.
