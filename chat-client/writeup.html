			<p>Once again, I did most of my development for this assignment in the format of a mobile-style screen, as that 
				is what I predict to be the most common use case for my app. This format is also what I tested in my paper 
				and figma prototypes. Due to this, although my design is universal, I suggest a mobile format (through Inspect) 
				for a better user experience.</p>

			<p>The main problem that my chat app seeks to target is the organization of academic groupchats. Platforms, such 
				as Piazza, provide a good centralized space for classroom interaction. However, they lack the casualness and 
				conventionality of regular messaging apps, such as Messeger.</p>

			<p> Through EduChat, users can join classes as they do on Piazza, these classes are created by a registrar entity 
				and are fixed based on the institution. Users can then join/leave classes. Within each class, users can create 
				groupchats amongst the class members. This was an important part of the second half of my implementation: limiting
				groupchat participants  </p>
